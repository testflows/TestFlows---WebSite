Discover how you can autoscale GitHub Actions runners using Hetzner Cloud, the github-hetzner-runners service, a practical tool designed to get your GitHub Actions workflow jobs running on your own servers. This service automatically starts servers in Hetzner Cloud when new GitHub Actions jobs are queued, providing dedicated ephemeral runners for each job. Once a job is completed, the service takes care of shutting down and reusing the server when possible, ensuring a cost-effective and streamlined process. This article will cover how you can use the github-hetzner-runners project for both x64 and arm64 runners, its straightforward setup, and how it manages costs effectively, making it a smart choice for any of your GitHub repository.


# How does GitHub Actions runners transform GitHub Actions workflows?

GitHub Actions runners offers a solution for GitHub Actions workflows by providing cost-efficient, on-demand runners utilizing Hetzner Cloud. It stands out for its simple configuration process, eliminating the need for complex setups like Webhooks, AWS Lambdas, or additional GitHub applications. Users benefit from the ability to customize runner server types, images, and locations using job labels, making it highly adaptable to specific project needs. The service is a self-contained program, allowing for easy deployment, redeployment, and management directly on a cloud instance. It supports a wide range of runner types, including both x64 (x86) and ARM64 (arm) architectures, and is compatible with any Hetzner Cloud server types and standard images or applications, even those with pre-installed Docker. Efficiency is further enhanced with features like auto-replenishable standby runner pools for immediate job uptake and the ability to limit the number of runners per workflow, ensuring resources are used wisely. Additionally, it optimizes GitHub API interactions through HTTP caching and conditional requests, presenting itself as a simpler, more efficient alternative to other autoscaling solutions recommended by GitHub.


# Understanding the Hetzner Cloud Utility's Requirements and Installation

GitHub Actions Runners have some important needs that you've got to follow to use them right.It does not support group runners and it requires a separate Hetzner Cloud projects for individual services per repository. This approach, while limiting concurrent repository management, facilitates cost tracking for each project.To utilize this utility, users must have Python version 3.7 or higher, a Hetzner Cloud account, and a GitHub API token with administrative rights. Installation is straightforward: GitHub Actions Runners can be installed via pip and requires confirmation of correct installation. It's important to ensure that the  installation directory, ~/.local/bin/, is included in the system's PATH. For Ubuntu users, this might involve modifying the ~/.profile to append the directory to the PATH, guaranteeing the utility's seamless integration into the user‚Äôs environment.


# Implementing Autoscaling GitHub Actions with Hetzner Runners

The installation process for TestFlows GitHub Runners begins with installing the **testflows.github.hetzner.runners** Python package using the pip3 command. After installation, it‚Äôs crucial to verify that **github-hetzner-runners** utility has been correctly installed by executing the **github-hetzner-runners -v** command.Github-hetzner-runners is typically installed in the ~/.local/bin/ directory, and users must ensure that this directory is part of their system's PATH environment variable. For Ubuntu users, this might require updating the ~/.profile file to include the directory. Additionally, for launching **github-hetzner-runners** program, it‚Äôs necessary to specify the GitHub repository along with GitHub and Hetzner Cloud tokens, which need to be created and securely stored.

To set up github-hetzner-runners, the first step is to create a GitHub repository named **demo-testflows-github-hetzner-runners**.After creating the repository, you need to establish a GitHub Actions workflow, which involves modifying an example YAML configuration to specify that the job will run on a self-hosted runner with specific labels like type-cpx21. This setup is detailed in the provided demo.yml file, which includes various steps and commands for the workflow. The final step in the setup process is creating a GitHub API token with workflow privileges, which is essential for managing the actions in the repository. It's crucial to securely save this token for subsequent use in setting up and managing the GitHub Actions.

The repository name will have the following format:

::

   <username>/demo-testflows-github-hetzner-runners

For me, my GitHub repository is:

::

   vzakaznikov/demo-testflows-github-hetzner-runners

To modify the example YAML configuration and specify that our job will run on a runner with the **self-hosted** and the **type-cpx21**
labels:

.. code-block:: yaml

     Explore-GitHub-Actions:
       runs-on: [self-hosted, type-cpx21]

To complete *demo.yml* that uses a self-hosted runner is as follows:  

:demo.yml:

   .. code-block:: yaml

      name: GitHub Actions Demo
      run-name: ${{ github.actor }} is testing out GitHub Actions üöÄ
      on: [push]
      jobs:
        Explore-GitHub-Actions:
          runs-on: [self-hosted, type-cpx21]
          steps:
            - run: echo "üéâ The job was automatically triggered by a ${{ github.event_name }} event."
            - run: echo "üêß This job is now running on a ${{ runner.os }} server hosted by GitHub!"
            - run: echo "üîé The name of your branch is ${{ github.ref }} and your repository is ${{ github.repository }}."
            - name: Check out repository code
              uses: actions/checkout@v3
            - run: echo "üí° The ${{ github.repository }} repository has been cloned to the runner."
            - run: echo "üñ•Ô∏è The workflow is now ready to test your code on the runner."
            - name: List files in the repository
              run: |
                ls ${{ github.workspace }}
            - run: echo "üçè This job's status is ${{ job.status }}."

To create a GitHub API token with the **workflow** privileges:

For me, my *demo* GitHub token is:

The next essential step in setting up the github-hetzner-runners that involves creating a Hetzner Cloud project and generating an API token for managing server instances. Begin by establishing a new project, named for example,**Demo GitHub Runners**. Once the project is set up, the next task is to create an API token within the Hetzner Cloud platform. This token plays a key role as it grants the necessary permissions to create and manage server instances within your Hetzner Cloud project. It‚Äôs important to securely store this token, as it will be used later in the configuration process. After completing these steps, your Hetzner Cloud project is ready for integration with the GitHub runners.

Once you have prepared your GitHub repository and acquired both GitHub and Hetzner Cloud tokens, you're ready to implement the github-hetzner-runners service to a Hetzner Cloud instance. This ensures that the service operates in the cloud rather than on a local machine, enhancing efficiency and scalability. The process involves creating an instance of **github-hetzner-runners** within your Hetzner Cloud project. To execute this, you use the **github-hetzner-runners cloud deploy** command,and specify your
GitHub repository, GitHub, and Hetzner Cloud tokens using **GITHUB_REPOSITORY**, **GITHUB_TOKEN**, and **HETZNER_TOKEN** environment variables.This process is straightforward and, once completed, results in an active and operational cloud service, ready to manage your GitHub Actions workflows.

You can install **github-hetzner-runners** straight from the source. Just copy the code from GitHub and run some commands to package and install it. After it's installed, it uses some default settings (like GITHUB_TOKEN, GITHUB_REPOSITORY, and HETZNER_TOKEN) to work properly. But if you want, you can change these settings using commands like --github-token, --github-repository, and --hetzner-token to make it fit what you need or prefer.


# How to optimize Github-Hetzner-Runners?

The **github-hetzner-runners** sets a default maximum limit of 10 runners, but this can be adjusted to fit your Hetzner Cloud limits using the --max-runners count option. Additionally, it does not define a default maximum number of runners for a single workflow run. However, it‚Äôs important to note that GitHub's system does not allow for the specific assignment of jobs to runners, meaning that any available runner matching the labels could be used.You can't control exactly how GitHub uses the runners, so setting the --max-runners-in-workflow-run might not work like you think. If you set it to a number, like X, the program will make X runners for each workflow run. But how GitHub decides to use these runners isn't something we can manage. This means if you have more workflows waiting, the program will make more runners, up to your maximum limit, to try and finish jobs quicker. Still, this doesn't mean you'll see exactly X jobs running for each workflow in the queue. For example, if you set --max-runners 40 --max-runners-in-workflow-run 5, you'll get up to 5 runners for each waiting workflow, and this number could go up to 40 if there are more workflows waiting, helping speed up the work that's already going on.

The **github-hetzner-runners** can recycles servers that have finished a job, instead of just deleting them. This helps save money because Hetzner Cloud charges by hour.Therefore, if a server only did a job for a few minutes, instead of getting rid of it, the program turns it off and then refreshes it for a new job. This means the server is like new for the next job. These servers are renamed with "recycle" in their name and are kept for almost an hour. For example, if a server is used for 2 hours and 50 minutes, it will be deleted because it has only *10* minutes or less of useful life, but if it's only used for 2 hours and 30 minutes, it can be used again. The program picks which server to delete based on cost and how much time it has left. If a new job comes in and doesn't match any recyclable servers and all the runners are busy, the program will delete the least costly server to make space. This process checks the server type, location, and SSH keys to match them with the job's needs. You can also turn off this recycling feature if you want.
